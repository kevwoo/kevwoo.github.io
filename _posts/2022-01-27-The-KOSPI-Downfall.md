The year 2022 is starting off as unprecedentedly weird on many sides, especially on economics.

The world is observing eye-popping inflations rates [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-12/inflation-in-u-s-registers-biggest-annual-gain-since-1982) and [there](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/24/inflation-has-risen-around-the-world-but-the-u-s-has-seen-one-of-the-biggest-increases/). U.S labor market seems to have recovered significantly as [unemployment rate in December 2021 decreased to  3.8%](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/laus.pdf), the lowest since the pandemic hit the nation. 

And yet, many doubt that the economy has fully recovered from covid-19. [The International Monetary Fund(IMF) has cut its prospective growth of global economy](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/1/25/recovery-disrupted-imf-cuts-global-economic-growth-forecast) and pandemic doesn't seem to end as more infectious Omicron variant cases show up.

In the middle of this bewildering signals, the Federal Reserve, partly under pressure from the Congress, announced its intention to raise Fed Funds Rate in the near future and halt its asset buying program in March. 

No more liquidity party, so to speak. 

Emerging markets took the hit the most. KOSPI and KOSDAQ indices, five hours after Fed Chairman Powell's virtual conference, opened with gap down and closed with its already-lowest number to new low.

This is noticeable because people were expecting an influx of cash into the stock market as LG Energy Solution, World's No.2 battery maker, just made its public offering on KOSPI today. 

Many 'civilian' investors in Korea started trading stocks right after the pandemic started so they weren't familiar with this much fall and everybody started to sell with panic. 

When the index will return to normal isn't something I am willing to answer right now, but it seems likely that the investors may need a month or two to shake their terror and grief up from their loss.
