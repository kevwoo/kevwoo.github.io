U.S labor market seems to have recovered significantly as unemployment rate in December 2021 decreased to 3.8%, the lowest since the pandemic hit the nation.And yet, many doubt that the economy has fully recovered from covid-19. The International Monetary Fund(IMF) has cut its prospective growth of global economy and pandemic doesn’t seem to end as more infectious Omicron variant cases show up.In the middle of this bewildering signals, the Federal Reserve, partly under pressure from the Congress, announced its intention to raise Fed Funds Rate in the near future and halt its asset buying program in March.No more liquidity party, so to speak.Emerging markets took the hit the most. KOSPI and KOSDAQ indices, five hours after Fed Chairman Powell’s virtual conference, opened with gap down and closed with its already-lowest number to new low.This is noticeable because people were expecting an influx of cash into the stock market as LG Energy Solution, World’s No.2 battery maker, just made its public offering on KOSPI today.Many ‘civilian’ investors in Korea started trading stocks right after the pandemic started so they weren’t familiar with this much fall and everybody started to sell with panic.When the index will return to normal isn’t something I am willing to answer right now, but it seems likely that the investors may need a month or two to shake their terror and grief up from their loss." }, { "title": "Customize the Favicon", "url": "/posts/customize-the-favicon/", "categories": "Blogging, Tutorial", "tags": "favicon", "date": "2019-08-11 01:34:00 +0900", "snippet": "The favicons of Chirpy are placed in the directory assets/img/favicons/.

Even if you have previous experience with Jekyll, this article is worth reading, because many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG] # TAG names should always be lowercase--- The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:---author: name: Full Name link: https://example.com---Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; }Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, height and width support abbreviations (height → h, width → w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=&quot;700&quot; h=&quot;400&quot; }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right. Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added. Normal position Image will be left aligned in below sample: ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal } Float to the left ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left } Float to the right ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right } ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect, and the shadow will be visible in the light mode:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&amp;lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png&quot; alt=&quot;The flower&quot;&amp;gt;Image PathWhen a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:---img_path: /img/path/---And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:![The flower](flower.png)The output will be:&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/img/path/flower.png&quot; alt=&quot;The flower&quot;&amp;gt;Preview ImageIf you want to add an image to the top of the post contents, specify the attribute src, width, height, and alt for the image:---image: src: /path/to/image/file width: 1000 # in pixels height: 400 # in pixels alt: image alternative text---Except for alt, all other options are necessary, especially the width and height, which are related to user experience and web page loading performance. The above section “Size” also mentions this.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, the attributes height and width can be abbreviated: height → h, width → w. In addition, the img_path can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the attribute src only needs the image file name.Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are three types of prompts, note, warning and danger. When writing, add the class prompt-{type} to a blockquote: Note &amp;gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-note } Warning &amp;gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-warning } Danger &amp;gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-danger } SyntaxInline Code`inline code part`Filepath Hightlight`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:```This is a plaintext code snippet.```Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value``` The Jekyll tag {% highlight %} is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class nolineno to it:```shellecho &#39;No more line numbers!&#39;```{: .nolineno }Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=&quot;path/to/file&quot; }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains &#39;Pack&#39; %} This product&#39;s title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post’s YAML block.Learn MoreFor more knowledge about Jekyll posts, visit the Jekyll Docs: Posts." }, { "title": "Text and Typography", "url": "/posts/text-and-typography/", "categories": "Blogging, Demo", "tags": "typography", "date": "2019-08-08 12:33:00 +0900", "snippet": "This post is to show Markdown syntax rendering on Chirpy, you can also use it as an example of writing.
